# Python Socks5 Proxy Server

This Python script implements a small Socks5 proxy server that can be used to route traffic between a client and a destination server. It provides a basic level of functionality to understand the fundamentals of Socks5 proxies.

**Features:**

* **Client Connections:** Establishes connections with client applications seeking to use the proxy service.
* **Destination Forwarding:** Acts as an intermediary, forwarding data requests from the client to the specified destination server.
* **Supported Address Types:** Handles IP V4 addresses and domain names for destination servers.
* **Authentication Method:** Currently limited to the `NO AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED` method. 

**Requirements:**

* Python 3 (tested with Python 3.x)

**How to Use:**

1. Save the script as `socks5_proxy.py`.
2. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python socks5_proxy.py
```

3. Configure your client application (web browser, email client, etc.) to use a proxy server running on `localhost` at port `9050` by default.

**Configuration:**

The script includes several constants at the beginning that control the server's behavior. You can modify these values to suit your needs:

* `MAX_THREADS`: Defines the maximum number of concurrent client connections the server can manage.
* `BUFSIZE`: Sets the size of the buffer used to transfer data between the client, server, and destination server.
* `TIMEOUT_SOCKET`: Specifies the timeout value (in seconds) for socket operations.
* `LOCAL_ADDR`: The IP address that the server listens on for incoming client connections. Defaults to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces).
* `LOCAL_PORT`: The port number that the server listens on. Defaults to `9050`.
* `OUTGOING_INTERFACE` (Optional): The network interface to bind the outgoing socket to. This functionality requires root privileges on your system. 

**Disclaimer:**

This is a basic implementation for educational purposes and should not be deployed in production environments without proper security measures. A Socks5 proxy can expose your traffic to the proxy server, so use it with caution on untrusted networks.

**Additional Notes:**

* The script utilizes Python's `threading` module to handle multiple client connections concurrently.
* Error handling and logging have been included to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.
